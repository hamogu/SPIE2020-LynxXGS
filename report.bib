 abstract = {We report on measurements of the diffraction efficiency of
200-nm-period freestanding blazed transmission gratings for
wavelengths in the 0.96 to 19.4 nm range. These
critical-angle transmission (CAT) gratings achieve highly
efficient blazing over a broad band via total external
reflection off the sidewalls of smooth, tens of nanometer
thin ultrahigh aspect-ratio silicon grating bars and thus
combine the advantages of blazed x-ray reflection gratings
with those of more conventional x-ray transmission
gratings. Prototype gratings with maximum depths of 3.2 and
6 $\mu$m were investigated at two different blaze angles.
In these initial CAT gratings the grating bars are
monolithically connected to a cross support mesh that only
leaves less than half of the grating area unobstructed.
Because of our initial fabrication approach, the support
mesh bars feature a strongly trapezoidal cross section that
leads to varying CAT grating depths and partial absorption
of diffracted orders. While theory predicts broadband
absolute diffraction efficiencies as high as 60\% for ideal
CAT gratings without a support mesh, experimental results
show efficiencies in the range of $\sim$50--100\% of
theoretical predictions when taking the effects of the
support mesh into account. Future minimization of the
support mesh therefore promises broadband CAT grating
absolute diffraction efficiencies of 50\% or higher.},

@inproceedings{heilmann:15,
 abstract = { High-resolution spectroscopy of astrophysical sources is
the key to gaining a quantitative understanding of the
history, dynamics, and current conditions of the cosmos. A
large-area (&gt; 1,000 cm2), high resolving power (R =
λ/Δλ&gt; 3000) soft x-ray grating spectrometer (XGS)
that covers the lines of C, N, O, Ne and Fe ions is the
ideal tool to address a number of high-priority science
questions from the 2010 Decadal Survey, such as the
connection between super-massive black holes and
large-scale structure via cosmic feedback, the evolution of
large- scale structure, the behavior of matter at high
densities, and the conditions close to black holes. While
no grating missions or instruments are currently approved,
an XGS aboard a potential future X-ray Surveyor could
easily surpass the above performance metrics. To improve
the chances for future soft x-ray grating spectroscopy
missions or instruments, grating technology has to progress
and advance to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).
To that end we have developed Critical-Angle Transmission
(CAT) gratings that combine the advantages of blazed
reflection gratings (high efficiency, use of higher
diffraction orders) with those of conventional transmission
gratings (low mass, relaxed alignment tolerances and
temperature requirements, high transparency at higher
energies). A CAT grating-based spectrometer can provide
performance 1-2 orders of magnitude better than current
grating instruments on Chandra and Newton-XMM with minimal
resource requirements. At present we have fabricated
large-area freestanding CAT gratings with narrow integrated
support structures from silicon-on- insulator wafers using
advanced lithography and a combination of deep reactive-ion
and wet etching. Our latest x-ray test results show record
high absolute diffraction efficiencies in blazed orders in
excess of 30% with room for improvement. },

  abstract	= {The aberrations of various types of curved constant-period
		  transmission gratings are discussed, using Fermat's
		  principle. We show that optimal performance is achieved
		  with a grating assembled from individual facets which form
		  a nonclosed surface. For this geometry, primary coma and
		  astigmatism are proportional to the facet size and, hence,
		  may be adapted to the angular resolution of a Wolter-type
		  telescope.}
